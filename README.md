# savings-calculator

This is a very simple tool to help one figure out how much their savings might be after a given period. 

It runs enitrely on the client side. 

I struggled with a couple of things, including refactoring my JS logic so I could chart performance in 
years rather than months, which proves quite heavy for the machine at >25 years

If you have any thoughts on UI or logic, let me know!
